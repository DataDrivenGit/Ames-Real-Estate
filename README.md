# Ames-Real-Estate
Predicting house prices
In this project, we train a model to predict the number of House Prices for city of Ames in Iowa based on imformation about house and its surroundings.
The data set was obtained from the Kaggle Website which contains over 70 attributes containg numerical adn catagorical data.

Model was build from incially erforming statustical and EDA Analysis and theby creating new featurs as well as trnsforming data to form normal distribution and then finally building
 several individual regression models such as Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boost and Adaboost , Gradiant Boost , LGB and XGBoost .
 We then use 'Stacking' approach to obtain fianl results

The key takeaway from the EDA and Modeling are

most important factors for house price are Total Area, Quality and Age of an house
having addninal features like Garage , Porch , air conditining and having bigger living area will increase price of house
Performing EDA and statustical analtsis to create features can improve results 


Below figure shows the first 100 Result of our model predictions  on the test set data
